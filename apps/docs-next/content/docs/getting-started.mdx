# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Termbridge depends on local tools that must be available in your PATH:

- **Node.js 18+** (for `npx termbridge`)
- **tmux** (terminal session manager)
- **cloudflared** (Cloudflare Quick Tunnel)

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install node tmux cloudflared
```

### Linux

Install Node and tmux through your package manager, then install cloudflared from Cloudflare:

```bash
# Example (Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs tmux
```

Cloudflare installation guide: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/

## Run Termbridge

```bash
npx termbridge
```

You should see:

- A local URL (ex: `http://127.0.0.1:51234`)
- A public tunnel URL
- An ASCII QR code

Open the public URL on your phone (or scan the QR code) to connect.

## What happens next

1. A local HTTP server starts on `127.0.0.1`.
2. A tmux session is created (or reused if it already exists).
3. A Cloudflare Quick Tunnel is launched.
4. A one-time token URL is printed and encoded into the QR code.
5. Your phone redeems the token and receives a session cookie.
6. The UI connects to the terminal via WebSocket.

## First session behavior

- Termbridge creates a tmux session (default name is derived from the port).
- The first terminal in the list is loaded automatically.
- You can create multiple sessions in dev by setting `TERMBRIDGE_SESSIONS`.

## Using an existing tmux session

If you pass `--session <name>` and that session already exists, Termbridge will attach to it instead of creating a new one.

## Next steps

- **CLI Reference** for flags and environment variables.
- **Usage** for multi-session workflows and mobile controls.
