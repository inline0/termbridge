# FAQ

## Does Termbridge run any backend server?

No. Everything runs locally on your machine. The only public surface is the Cloudflare tunnel.

## Can I run multiple terminals?

Yes. One server can host multiple tmux sessions. Use the terminal switcher in the UI to select a session.

## Is the tunnel URL secure?

Termbridge issues a one-time token and redeems it for a cookie session. The token URL should only be shared with devices you trust.

## Can I use it without Cloudflare?

Not yet. The tunnel provider is currently Cloudflare only.

## Does it support Windows?

Not officially. macOS and Linux are the target platforms for the MVP.

## Can I beam other tools (Codex, OpenCode, Claude Code)?

Yes. If those tools run inside a tmux session on your machine, Termbridge will stream them just like any other terminal.
