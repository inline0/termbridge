# Usage

## Multiple terminals

Termbridge can host multiple tmux sessions from a single server. The UI includes a terminal switcher sheet for selecting a session.

Termbridge only lists sessions it created or attached to in the current run.

### Development shortcut

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_SESSIONS=3 bun run dev:beam
```

This will create three sessions: `<base>`, `<base>-2`, and `<base>-3`.

### Switching sessions

1. Tap the terminal switcher button (terminal icon) in the input bar.
2. Select a session from the list.
3. The UI navigates to `/app/terminal/:terminalId` and connects the WebSocket.

## Mobile controls

The action bar provides common terminal keys:

- `Enter`
- Arrow keys
- `Tab`
- `Esc`
- `Ctrl+C`

The bar is horizontally scrollable on mobile and uses scroll snapping for quick access.

## Sending input

- Type in the input field and press **Enter** to send.
- Use the send button to submit the input immediately.

## Tips

- For TUIs that rely on size (like `htop`), rotate the device or resize the browser to trigger a terminal fit.
- Use tmux panes/windows as you normally would; Termbridge streams the active tmux session.

## Beaming AI tools

If you run tools like Codex, OpenCode, or Claude Code inside tmux, Termbridge will stream them like any other terminal.

Example flow:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s codex
tmux send-keys -t codex "codex" Enter
termbridge start --session codex
```
