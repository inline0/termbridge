# Introduction

Termbridge is a local-first CLI that beams your terminal to any browser. It runs a local server, streams a real tmux session into an xterm.js UI, and exposes the server through a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel so you can open it on your phone.

## What you get

- **One command**: `npx termbridge` starts the server, creates a tmux session, and prints a QR code.
- **Real terminal**: tmux + node-pty means true colors, TUIs, and proper key handling.
- **Multi-session**: one server can host multiple tmux sessions, switchable in-app.
- **No backend**: everything runs on your machine. The tunnel is the only public surface.

## Core ideas

### Local-first by default

The server, WebSocket, and terminal registry live locally. There is no Termbridge-operated backend, and no data is stored externally.

### Secure handoff

Termbridge issues a one-time token and redeems it into a cookie session. The token URL is what you scan on mobile.

### Mobile-friendly UI

The UI is intentionally minimal: a full-height terminal with a compact control bar and a terminal switcher sheet.

## Quick peek

```bash
npx termbridge
```

Scan the QR code, open the URL, and you should see your terminal instantly.
