# Troubleshooting

## `tmux` not found

Install tmux and ensure it is on your PATH.

```bash
brew install tmux
```

## `cloudflared` not found

Install Cloudflare's tunnel client.

```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

## Tunnel failed to start

- Verify `cloudflared` runs on its own (`cloudflared --version`).
- Ensure you can reach `https://trycloudflare.com` from your network.
- Termbridge will still print the local URL if the tunnel fails.

## Blank UI or "Unable to load terminals"

- Confirm the local server is running.
- Check the browser console for 401 or 403 responses.
- Restart the CLI to get a fresh redemption token.

## No terminal output

- Make sure the tmux session is running: `tmux ls`.
- If you are already inside tmux, the session should still appear.
- Check that your shell supports `TERM=xterm-256color`.

## QR code opens but shows a blank page on mobile

- The QR URL is single-use. Run `npx termbridge` again to regenerate.
- Verify your phone can access the tunnel URL.

## `node-pty` spawn-helper errors

Termbridge attempts to mark `node-pty`'s spawn-helper as executable. If it fails:

```bash
chmod +x node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/**/spawn-helper
```
