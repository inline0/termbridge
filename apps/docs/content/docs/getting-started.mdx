# Getting Started

## Install the prerequisites

Termbridge needs three tools installed on your computer:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Node.js 18+

    Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or use your package manager.

    ```bash
    # Check if installed
    node --version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### tmux

    The terminal multiplexer that powers Termbridge sessions.

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install tmux

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt install tmux
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### cloudflared

    Creates the secure tunnel to your terminal.

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install cloudflared

    # Linux - see cloudflare.com/downloads
    ```

    [Download cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Run Termbridge

```bash
npx termbridge
```

You'll see output like this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Termbridge                             │
│                                         │

│  Public:  https://abc123.trycloudflare.com │

│  ██          ██  <- Scan this QR code   │
│  ██████████████                         │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `trycloudflare.com` URL is a quick, account-less tunnel. If you use Termbridge frequently,
  set up a named Cloudflare tunnel token to avoid rate limits.
</Callout>

## Connect from your phone

1. Open your phone's camera
2. Point it at the QR code
3. Tap the link that appears
4. Your terminal loads in the browser

That's it - you're connected!

## What just happened?

1. Termbridge started a local server on your machine
2. It created a tmux session for your terminal
3. Cloudflare created a secure tunnel (the `trycloudflare.com` URL)
4. The QR code contains a one-time token for secure access
5. When you scanned it, you got a session cookie and connected

## Try it out

Once connected, try some commands:

```bash
# See system info
htop

# Check a git repo
cd ~/your-project && git status

# Run any CLI tool
```

The terminal supports full colors, TUIs, and all the keys you'd expect.

## Keep it running

Termbridge needs to stay running for the connection to work. When you're done:

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Termbridge is running
- The tunnel closes and the connection ends
- Your tmux session stays alive (unless you used `--kill-on-exit`)

## First session behavior

- Termbridge creates a tmux session (default name is derived from the port)
- The first terminal in the list is loaded automatically
- You can create multiple sessions in dev by setting `TERMBRIDGE_SESSIONS=2`

## Using an existing tmux session

If you pass `--session <name>` and that session already exists, Termbridge will attach to it instead of creating a new one. This is useful for monitoring long-running processes you've already started.
