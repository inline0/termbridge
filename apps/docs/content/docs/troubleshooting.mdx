# Troubleshooting

## "tmux not found"

tmux isn't installed or isn't in your PATH.

```bash
# macOS
brew install tmux

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tmux
```

## "cloudflared not found"

Cloudflare's tunnel client isn't installed.

```bash
# macOS
brew install cloudflared
```

For Linux, download from [cloudflare.com/downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).

## Tunnel won't start

A few things to check:

1. Verify cloudflared works: `cloudflared --version`
2. Make sure you can reach `https://trycloudflare.com`
3. Check if a firewall is blocking outbound connections

Even if the tunnel fails, Termbridge will still work locally - you'll see a local URL you can use on the same network.

## Blank screen or "Unable to load terminals"

This usually means the session expired or something went wrong with auth:

1. Check if the local server is still running
2. Look at the browser console for 401/403 errors
3. Restart Termbridge to get a fresh URL and QR code

## No output in the terminal

The tmux session might not be running:

```bash
# Check if sessions exist
tmux ls
```

If sessions show up but the terminal is blank, try:
- Reloading the page
- Checking that your shell supports `TERM=xterm-256color`

## QR code scans but page is blank

The QR code contains a one-time token. If you've already scanned it once, it won't work again.

Solution: Restart Termbridge to generate a new QR code.

## node-pty errors about spawn-helper

Termbridge tries to fix this automatically, but if you see permission errors:

```bash
chmod +x node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/**/spawn-helper
```
