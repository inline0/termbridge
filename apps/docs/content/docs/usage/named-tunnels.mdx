description: Use your own Cloudflare tunnel to avoid rate limits.

# Named Tunnels

By default, Termbridge uses Cloudflare's account-less Quick Tunnels (`trycloudflare.com`). These are convenient but can be rate-limited with heavy use.

If you use Termbridge frequently, set up a named tunnel with your Cloudflare account.

## Why use a named tunnel?

- **No rate limits**: Quick Tunnels can return 429 errors under heavy use
- **Consistent URL**: Get a stable subdomain instead of random strings
- **Custom domain**: Use your own domain like `term.example.com`
- **Better reliability**: Named tunnels are more stable for long sessions

## Setup

### 1. Create a Cloudflare account

Sign up at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com) if you don't have one.

### 2. Create a tunnel in Zero Trust

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Networks** → **Tunnels**
3. Click **Create a tunnel**
4. Choose **Cloudflared** as the connector
5. Name your tunnel (e.g., `termbridge`)
6. Copy the tunnel token

### 3. Add a public hostname

1. In the tunnel settings, go to **Public Hostname**
2. Add a hostname that points to `http://localhost:8080` (or your chosen port)
3. Use a subdomain like `term.example.com`

### 4. Run Termbridge with your token

```bash
termbridge --port 8080 --tunnel-token <TOKEN> --tunnel-url https://term.example.com
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
export TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL_URL=https://term.example.com

termbridge --port 8080
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `--port` flag is required with named tunnels because the hostname is configured to point to a specific port.
</Callout>

## Configuration options

| Flag | Environment Variable | Description |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| `--port <port>` | - | Local port (required with named tunnels) |
| `--tunnel-token <token>` | `TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | Your tunnel token |
| `--tunnel-url <url>` | `TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL_URL` | Your public hostname URL |

## Disabling the tunnel entirely

If you have your own reverse proxy or public URL:

```bash
termbridge --no-tunnel --public-url https://your-server.com
```

Or:

```bash
export TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL=none
export TERMBRIDGE_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-server.com

termbridge
```

Termbridge will skip starting a tunnel and use your provided URL for the QR code.

## Troubleshooting

### "429 Too Many Requests"

This means Quick Tunnels are rate-limited. Solutions:

1. Wait a few minutes and retry
2. Kill any stale `cloudflared` processes: `pkill cloudflared`
3. Switch to a named tunnel (recommended)

### Tunnel starts but URL doesn't work

- Verify the hostname in Cloudflare matches `--tunnel-url`
- Check that the port in Cloudflare matches `--port`
- Ensure cloudflared is up to date: `cloudflared update`

### Named tunnel won't connect

- Verify your token is correct
- Check Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard for errors
- Try running `cloudflared tunnel run <TOKEN>` directly to see error messages
