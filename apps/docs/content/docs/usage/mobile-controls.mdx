# Mobile Controls

Termbridge is designed for phones and tablets. The control bar gives you quick access to keys that are hard to type on a touchscreen.

## Control bar

| Button | What it sends |
|--------|---------------|
| `Enter` | Submit commands |
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Arrow keys (history, navigation) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete |
| `Esc` | Exit modes, cancel |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt/kill process |

The bar scrolls horizontally - swipe to see more options.

## Sending input

1. Type in the input field at the bottom
2. Press **Enter** or tap the send button
3. Your command runs in the terminal

The input field supports pasting from your clipboard, so you can copy commands from notes or messages.

## Landscape mode

Rotate your phone to landscape for more screen space. This is especially useful for:

- TUIs like `htop`, `vim`, or `lazygit`
- Wide command output
- Reading logs with long lines

  Some phones have a rotation lock - make sure it's disabled if the screen won't rotate.

## Keyboard tips

If you have a Bluetooth keyboard connected:

- All standard keys work as expected
- `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and other shortcuts work directly
- The on-screen control bar is still available for convenience

## Touch gestures

- **Tap** the terminal to focus it
- **Swipe** the control bar to see more buttons
- **Long press** to select text (browser-dependent)

## Accessibility

The terminal uses a monospace font sized for readability on small screens. If text is too small:

- Use landscape mode for more width
- Pinch to zoom (browser zoom, not terminal resize)
- Some browsers support text scaling in accessibility settings
