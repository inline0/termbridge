# Dev Server Preview

Termbridge can proxy your local dev server and show it in a preview pane. This is perfect for mobile testing or watching your app while running terminal commands.

## Quick start

```bash
# Start your dev server (e.g., Vite on port 5173)
cd my-app && npm run dev

# In another terminal, start Termbridge with proxy
termbridge --proxy 5173
```

Now you can switch between **Terminal** and **Preview** views in the UI.

## How it works

When you pass `--proxy <port>`:

1. All Termbridge routes stay under `/__tb/`
2. All other requests are proxied to your dev server
3. The UI shows a **Views** button to toggle between Terminal and Preview
4. Preview loads your app in an iframe through the proxy

```
Browser → Termbridge → Your dev server (localhost:5173)
```

## Switching views

1. Tap the **Views** button in the bottom bar
2. Choose **Switch to Terminal** or **Switch to Preview**
3. The view updates instantly

Both views stay connected - your terminal session continues while you're viewing the preview.

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Vite's HMR works through the proxy. WebSocket connections to `/_vite/ws` are forwarded to your dev server automatically.

Edit your code and see changes in the Preview view instantly - no refresh needed.

## Supported frameworks

Any dev server that runs on a local port works:

| Framework | Command | Default Port |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Vite | `npm run dev` | 5173 |
| Next.js | `npm run dev` | 3000 |
| Create React App | `npm start` | 3000 |
| Nuxt | `npm run dev` | 3000 |
| SvelteKit | `npm run dev` | 5173 |

Just match the `--proxy` port to your dev server's port.

## Use cases

### Mobile testing

Test your responsive design on a real phone:

```bash
termbridge --proxy 5173
```

Scan the QR code and see your app exactly as it renders on mobile Safari or Chrome.

### Full-stack development

Run commands in the terminal while watching your app:

1. Watch build output in Terminal view
2. See your app in Preview view
3. Switch between them with a tap
4. Keep working from your phone or tablet

### Demo your work

Share the public URL with someone to show them:

- Your running app (Preview)
- Your terminal session (Terminal)

Great for remote pairing or quick demos.

## Sandbox mode

When using Daytona sandboxes, set the preview port:

```bash
export TERMBRIDGE_SANDBOX_DAYTONA_PREVIEW_PORT=5173
```

Make sure your dev server binds to all interfaces:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

Termbridge proxies the Daytona preview URL through the UI.

## Troubleshooting

### Preview shows blank page

- Make sure your dev server is running
- Check that the port matches `--proxy`
- For sandbox mode, use `--host 0.0.0.0` so the port is reachable

### HMR not working

- Verify your dev server supports HMR
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Some frameworks need explicit HMR configuration

### CORS errors

The proxy handles most CORS issues, but if your app makes requests to other origins:

- Configure your dev server's CORS settings
- Or use a browser extension to bypass CORS (for development only)
