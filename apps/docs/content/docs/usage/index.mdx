## Quick tips

- **Landscape mode**: Rotate your phone for more screen space with TUIs
- **tmux commands work**: `Ctrl+B` shortcuts function as normal
- **Auto-reconnect**: If you lose connection, just refresh the page
- **Session persistence**: tmux sessions survive Termbridge restarts (unless you use `--kill-on-exit`)

## Limitations

- **Single PTY**: Multiple viewers see the same terminal and can all type
- **Tunnel required**: Without a tunnel (or sandbox direct mode), you need your own public URL
- **Cloudflare only**: Currently the only tunnel provider (or use `--no-tunnel` / sandbox direct mode)
