# FAQ

## Is my data going through someone else's server?

By default, everything runs on your machine. Cloudflare creates a tunnel, but your terminal data goes directly from your browser to your computer - nothing is stored anywhere else. If you use Daytona sandbox mode, the server runs in your sandbox and data stays inside your Daytona account.

## How secure is the connection?

Pretty secure:
- The URL includes a one-time token that expires after use
- Sessions are protected by HttpOnly cookies
- All traffic is encrypted via HTTPS

Just don't share the QR code or URL with people you don't trust.

## Can I run multiple terminals at once?

Yes. Termbridge can run several tmux sessions simultaneously. Use the terminal switcher in the UI to jump between them.

## Will it work with Claude Code, Codex, or other AI tools?

Absolutely. If it runs in a terminal, Termbridge can stream it. Start your AI coding tool in the tmux session, and you can monitor it from your phone.

## Does it work on Windows?

Not officially. Termbridge is built for macOS and Linux. It might work with WSL, but it's not tested.

## Can I use a different tunnel provider?

Not yet - Cloudflare is the only tunnel provider right now. You can also disable the tunnel entirely or use Daytona direct mode.

## What happens if I close my laptop?

In local mode, the tunnel stays active as long as Termbridge is running. If your computer sleeps or Termbridge exits, the connection closes. Your tmux sessions stay alive though, so you can restart Termbridge and reconnect. In Daytona direct mode, the server runs inside the sandbox, so you can close your laptop and reconnect later.

## Can multiple people connect at once?

Yes, but they all see the same terminal. It's a single PTY, so multiple viewers see the same output and can all type. Think of it like screen sharing for your terminal.
