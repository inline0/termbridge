# Usage

## Mobile controls

When you're on a phone or tablet, you'll see a control bar with common keys:

| Button | What it sends |
|--------|---------------|
| `Enter` | Submit commands |
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Arrow keys (history, navigation) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete |
| `Esc` | Exit modes, cancel |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt/kill process |

The bar scrolls horizontally - swipe to see more options.

<Callout type="info">
  Tip: Rotate your phone to landscape mode for more screen space when running TUIs like htop or vim.

## Multiple terminals

Need more than one terminal? Termbridge can run several at once. One server can host multiple tmux sessions, and the UI includes a terminal switcher for selecting between them.

Termbridge only lists sessions it created or attached to in the current run.

### Development shortcut

For development, you can start multiple sessions at once:

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_SESSIONS=3 npx termbridge
```

This creates three sessions: `<base>`, `<base>-2`, and `<base>-3`.

### Switch between terminals

1. Tap the terminal icon in the bottom bar
2. A list of available sessions appears
3. Tap one to switch

### Create a new terminal

In the terminal switcher, tap "New Terminal" to create an additional session.

### Use case: Build + logs

Run your build in one terminal, tail logs in another:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Build
npm run build

# Terminal 2: Logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```

Switch between them without losing your place.

## Dev server preview

Use `--proxy` to preview your local dev server alongside the terminal. This is perfect for mobile testing or watching your app while running commands.

### Proxy a Vite app

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start your Vite app
cd my-app && npm run dev  # runs on port 5173

# Terminal 2: Start Termbridge with proxy
termbridge --proxy 5173
```

The UI shows **Terminal** and **Preview** tabs at the top:
- **Terminal tab**: Your tmux session, same as always
- **Preview tab**: An iframe loading your app through the proxy

### HMR support

Vite's Hot Module Replacement works through the proxy - WebSocket connections to `/_vite/ws` are forwarded to your dev server. Edit your code and see changes in the Preview tab instantly.

### Use case: Full-stack development

Run your build, watch tests, or tail logs in the terminal while previewing your app:

```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# In another terminal
termbridge --proxy 5173
```

Now you can:
1. Watch build output in the Terminal tab
2. See your app in the Preview tab
3. Switch between them with a tap
4. Keep working from your phone

## Named Cloudflare tunnels (avoid rate limits)

Account-less `trycloudflare.com` tunnels can be rate-limited. If you have a Cloudflare account, use a named tunnel token instead.

1. Create a tunnel in Cloudflare Zero Trust
2. Add a public hostname that points to `http://localhost:<port>`
3. Run Termbridge with a fixed port and your token

```bash
termbridge --port 8080 --tunnel-token <TOKEN> --tunnel-url https://term.example.com
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=<TOKEN> TERMBRIDGE_TUNNEL_URL=https://term.example.com termbridge --port 8080
```

## Running AI coding tools

Termbridge works great for monitoring AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode.

### Watch Claude Code from your phone

```bash
# Start a named session
termbridge --session claude

# In another terminal, attach Claude Code to it
tmux send-keys -t claude "claude" Enter
```

Now scan the QR and watch Claude work from anywhere.

### Codex workflow

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s codex
tmux send-keys -t codex "codex" Enter
termbridge start --session codex
```

If you run tools like Codex, OpenCode, or Claude Code inside tmux, Termbridge will stream them like any other terminal.

### Attach to an existing session

If you already have a tmux session running:

```bash
termbridge --session my-existing-session
```

Termbridge will connect to it instead of creating a new one.

## Common workflows

### Monitor a long-running process

```bash
# Start termbridge
npx termbridge

# In the terminal, run your process
npm run build  # or any long task
```

Scan the QR, put your phone in your pocket, check back later.

### Quick server check

```bash
# SSH into a server in tmux, then beam it
tmux new-session -d -s server "ssh user@myserver.com"
termbridge --session server
```

### Pair programming (sort of)

Share the public URL with someone - they can watch (and type) in real-time. Just remember the URL is only secured by the one-time token, so only share with people you trust.

## Sending input

- Type in the input field and press **Enter** to send
- Use the send button to submit the input immediately
- The action bar provides quick access to common terminal keys

## Tips

- **Fonts matter**: The terminal looks best when your system has a monospace font loaded
- **Resize works**: Rotate your device or resize the browser to adjust the terminal size. For TUIs that rely on size (like `htop`), this will trigger a terminal fit.
- **tmux commands work**: `Ctrl+B` shortcuts work as normal (though you might need to type them in the input field)
- **tmux panes/windows**: Use tmux panes and windows as you normally would - Termbridge streams the active tmux session
- **Reconnect automatically**: If you lose connection, just refresh the page

## Limitations

- **One user at a time**: The terminal is a single PTY - multiple viewers see the same thing and can all type
- **Session persistence**: If Termbridge exits, the tunnel closes (but tmux sessions stay unless you used `--kill-on-exit`)
- **Cloudflare only**: Currently only supports Cloudflare tunnels (more providers planned)
