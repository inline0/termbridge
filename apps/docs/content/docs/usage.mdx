# Usage

## Mobile controls

When you're on a phone or tablet, you'll see a control bar with common keys:

| Button | What it sends |
|--------|---------------|
| `Enter` | Submit commands |
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Arrow keys (history, navigation) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete |
| `Esc` | Exit modes, cancel |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt/kill process |

The bar scrolls horizontally - swipe to see more options.

<Callout type="info">
  Tip: Rotate your phone to landscape mode for more screen space when running TUIs like htop or vim.
</Callout>

## Multiple terminals

Need more than one terminal? Termbridge can run several at once.

### Switch between terminals

1. Tap the terminal icon in the bottom bar
2. A list of available sessions appears
3. Tap one to switch

### Create a new terminal

In the terminal switcher, tap "New Terminal" to create an additional session.

### Use case: Build + logs

Run your build in one terminal, tail logs in another:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Build
npm run build

# Terminal 2: Logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```

Switch between them without losing your place.

## Running AI coding tools

Termbridge works great for monitoring AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode.

### Watch Claude Code from your phone

```bash
# Start a named session
termbridge --session claude

# In another terminal, attach Claude Code to it
tmux send-keys -t claude "claude" Enter
```

Now scan the QR and watch Claude work from anywhere.

### Attach to an existing session

If you already have a tmux session running:

```bash
termbridge --session my-existing-session
```

Termbridge will connect to it instead of creating a new one.

## Common workflows

### Monitor a long-running process

```bash
# Start termbridge
npx termbridge

# In the terminal, run your process
npm run build  # or any long task
```

Scan the QR, put your phone in your pocket, check back later.

### Quick server check

```bash
# SSH into a server in tmux, then beam it
tmux new-session -d -s server "ssh user@myserver.com"
termbridge --session server
```

### Pair programming (sort of)

Share the public URL with someone - they can watch (and type) in real-time. Just remember the URL is only secured by the one-time token, so only share with people you trust.

## Tips

- **Fonts matter**: The terminal looks best when your system has a monospace font loaded
- **Resize works**: Rotate your device or resize the browser to adjust the terminal size
- **tmux commands work**: `Ctrl+B` shortcuts work as normal (though you might need to type them in the input field)
- **Reconnect automatically**: If you lose connection, just refresh the page

## Limitations

- **One user at a time**: The terminal is a single PTY - multiple viewers see the same thing and can all type
- **Session persistence**: If Termbridge exits, the tunnel closes (but tmux sessions stay unless you used `--kill-on-exit`)
- **Cloudflare only**: Currently only supports Cloudflare tunnels (more providers planned)
