# Sandboxes

Termbridge can use a sandbox instead of a local tmux session. This is useful when you want a terminal and preview that run in the cloud but keep the same Termbridge UI and sharing workflow.

## When to use sandboxes

- You want a terminal in a disposable cloud environment.
- You need a preview that runs in a sandbox, not on your laptop.
- You are running CI or integration tests against a remote environment.

If you just need to share your local terminal, use the default tmux backend.

## Sandbox providers

Termbridge currently supports:

- **Daytona** - Cloud sandboxes with repo cloning and preview ports. See the [Daytona guide](/docs/sandboxes/daytona).

More providers are coming.

## Quick start

1. Pick a provider and follow its setup guide.
2. Set the sandbox backend and repository configuration.
3. Run Termbridge as usual:

```bash
npx termbridge
```

For Daytona, follow the [Daytona quick start](/docs/sandboxes/daytona#quick-start).

## Coding agents

Termbridge can install coding agents inside the sandbox and sync your local auth so they are ready immediately.

See the [Coding agents](/docs/sandboxes/coding-agents) guide for the full setup, automatic mode, and security details.

## Preview mode

Sandbox providers can expose a preview port that Termbridge proxies into the UI. See your provider guide for the exact flags and environment variables.
