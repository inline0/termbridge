# Daytona

Daytona lets Termbridge run your terminal and preview in a cloud sandbox. Use this when you want a reproducible environment, a cloud preview, or to keep your laptop idle.

## Requirements

- A Daytona API key
- A repository URL the sandbox can clone
- Git credentials if the repo is private

## Quick start

Set the backend to Daytona and provide the repo configuration:

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_BACKEND=daytona
DAYTONA_API_KEY=your_key
DAYTONA_API_URL=https://app.daytona.io/api
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_REPO=https://github.com/inline0/termbridge-test-app.git
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_BRANCH=main
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PATH=termbridge-test-app
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_NAME=termbridge-sandbox
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PUBLIC=true
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PREVIEW_PORT=5173
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_DELETE_ON_EXIT=true
```

Then run Termbridge as usual:

```bash
npx termbridge
```

## Direct sandbox mode (no tunnel)

Direct mode runs the Termbridge server inside the sandbox and skips Cloudflare entirely. The share URL is the Daytona preview link to the sandboxed server.

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_BACKEND=daytona
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_DIRECT=true
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_SERVER_PORT=8080
```

You can still enable preview by setting `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PREVIEW_PORT`; in direct mode it is forwarded as the server `--proxy` port.

## Repository cloning

Termbridge will create a sandbox and clone your repo into the sandbox working directory.

Use these settings:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_REPO` | Repo URL to clone (required) |
| `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_BRANCH` | Branch to check out (optional) |
| `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PATH` | Path for the repo in the sandbox (optional) |
| `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_NAME` | Sandbox name (optional) |

If `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PATH` is not set, Termbridge derives it from the repo name.

## Private repositories

Provide git credentials when cloning private repos:

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_GIT_USERNAME=your_github_username
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_GIT_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

`TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_GIT_PASSWORD` is also supported and overrides the token if set.

## Coding agents

Termbridge can install coding agents inside the sandbox and sync your local auth so they are ready immediately.

See the [Coding agents](/docs/sandboxes/coding-agents) guide for the full setup, automatic mode, and security details.

## Preview mode

To show the preview view, set `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PREVIEW_PORT` to the port your dev server uses inside the sandbox.

For Vite, make sure you bind to all interfaces:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

Termbridge fetches the Daytona preview link and proxies it through the Termbridge server so the preview loads inside the UI.

## Public vs private sandboxes

| Variable | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PUBLIC=true` | Creates a public sandbox |
| `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PUBLIC=false` | Creates a private sandbox |

For private sandboxes, Termbridge forwards the preview token automatically when proxying the preview.

## Cleanup and lifecycle

To delete sandboxes when Termbridge exits:

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_DELETE_ON_EXIT=true
```

For short-lived or test sandboxes, use a prefix:

```bash
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_NAME=termbridge-test-$(date +%s)
TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_DELETE_ON_EXIT=true
```

This keeps sandbox usage under control and avoids disk quota issues.

## CLI flags

You can also configure Daytona via flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--backend daytona` | Use the Daytona backend |
| `--daytona-repo <url>` | Repo URL |
| `--daytona-branch <branch>` | Branch |
| `--daytona-path <path>` | Repo path in sandbox |
| `--daytona-name <name>` | Sandbox name |
| `--daytona-preview-port <port>` | Preview port |
| `--daytona-public` | Create a public sandbox |
| `--daytona-direct` | Run the server inside the sandbox (no tunnel) |

## Troubleshooting

**Preview view is blank**
- Ensure the dev server is running inside the sandbox.
- Use `--host 0.0.0.0` so the preview port is reachable.
- Confirm `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_PREVIEW_PORT` matches the dev server port.

**Sandbox creation fails with quota errors**
- Delete old sandboxes in the Daytona dashboard.
- Use `TERMBRIDGE_DAYTONA_DELETE_ON_EXIT=true` for short-lived sessions.

**Repo clone fails**
- Double-check repo URL, branch, and credentials.
- Ensure the Git token has repo read access.
