# Your terminal, anywhere

Termbridge lets you access your local terminal from any device with a browser. Run one command, scan a QR code, and you're connected.

```bash
npx termbridge
```

That's it. Your terminal is now accessible from your phone.

## Why Termbridge?

**Check builds from the couch.** Kicked off a long build? Watch it finish from your phone while you grab coffee.

**Monitor servers on the go.** SSH'd into a server running a process? Keep an eye on it from anywhere.

**Run AI coding tools remotely.** Using Claude Code, Codex, or similar tools? Watch them work from your tablet while you're away from your desk.

**Quick access, no setup.** No port forwarding, no VPN, no complicated configuration. Just run the command and scan.

## How it works

1. You run `npx termbridge` on your computer
2. Termbridge creates a secure tunnel to your terminal
3. You scan the QR code (or copy the URL)
4. Your terminal appears in your browser, fully interactive

Everything runs locally on your machine. The tunnel just makes it accessible - no data is stored anywhere else.

## Core design

**Local-first.** The server, WebSocket, and terminal registry live on your machine. There is no Termbridge-operated backend, and no data is stored externally.

**Secure handoff.** Termbridge issues a one-time token and redeems it into a cookie session. The token URL is what you scan on mobile.

**Mobile-friendly.** The UI is intentionally minimal: a full-height terminal with a compact control bar and a terminal switcher sheet.

## What you can do

- **Full terminal access** - Colors, TUIs like htop, vim, and proper key handling all work
- **Multiple sessions** - Run several terminals and switch between them in the app
- **Mobile controls** - On-screen buttons for Ctrl+C, arrows, Tab, and other keys
- **Secure by default** - One-time tokens mean only you can connect

## Quick start

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), and [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) installed, then:

```bash
npx termbridge
```

Scan the QR code with your phone and you're in.
